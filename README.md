**Why?**  
Mailchimp's exported HTML is cluttered with extra branding, social links, and inconsistent backgrounds. Embedding this directly into an iframe on the XRB website can cause layout and style issues.

**How to use:**
1. Export your Mailchimp campaign as HTML.
2. Paste or upload the HTML into Mailchimp Magic.
3. Toggle cleaning options as needed (remove footers, banners, social, standardize backgrounds).
4. Preview the cleaned result.
5. Copy or download the cleaned HTML.
6. Embed the cleaned HTML into an iframe on the XRB website.

> **This tool is optimized for XRB's workflow and ensures your embedded content looks professional and matches the XRB brand.**
